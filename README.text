I had wanted to get this portfolio done , since 2021/22 .
It took me so long but here we are today in February 2025.

PORTFOLIO
 For this portfolio , i am implementing AstroJS for the first time 
 becasue of it a all in one web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce. Astro is best-known for pioneering a new frontend architecture to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity compared to other frameworks. Itloads fast and has great SEO, then Astro is for you.

I settled for it because :
Content-driven: Astro was designed to showcase your content.
Server-first: Websites run faster when they render HTML on the server.
Fast by default: It should be impossible to build a slow website in Astro.
Easy to use: You donâ€™t need to be an expert to build something with Astro.
Developer-focused: 



React + Tailwindcss + Astro

 1. Astro-navbar for the navbar was used- https://github.com/surjithctly/astro-navbar
