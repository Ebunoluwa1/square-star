          Hi there! I am Ebunoluwa, I am a passionate <strong>
            Frontend developer
          </strong> dedicated to building high-quality software, crafting seamless
          and engaging user experiences that solves real-life problems and makes
          people's lives easier. I like solving problems and bringing ideas to life
          through code.
          <br />I enjoy working on projects that blend functionality with great
          design, such as <strong>JustBeans</strong>, where I independently
          built a full-fledged business website integrating authentication,
          payments, and user engagement. My experience working with Supabase,
          API integrations, and payment gateways like React Paystack has
          strengthened my ability to create dynamic, real-world applications
          that make a positive impact on businesses.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          My expertise lies in <strong>frontend development</strong>, with a
          focus on web applications. I'm proficient in JavaScript and
          comfortable working with frameworks and tools like <strong
            >React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js.</strong
          >
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition to my technical skills, I excel at collaborating with
            team members and communicating effectively. My strengths go beyond
            technical proficiencyâ€”I thrive in team environments, bringing a
            growth mindset, keen attention to detail, and a drive for excellence
            to every line of code. Beyond coding, I'm a lifelong learner
            committed to continuous improvement. Whether it's exploring new
            frameworks, debugging complex issues, or optimizing performance, I
            embrace every challenge as an opportunity to grow.
          </p><br />
          <p>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy writing about my learnings on <strong>

            sharing insights on problem-solving, development best practices, and
            self-improvement. I'm excited about opportunities that allow me to build
            impactful,scalable and dynamic applications, collaborate with like-minded
            individuals, and continue growing as a developer. I'm always looking
            for new opportunities to work on exciting projects, so if you're interested
