        <p>
          Hi there! I am Ebunoluwa, a passionate <strong
            >Frontend developer</strong
          > dedicated to building high-quality software and crafting seamless user
          experiences that solve real-life problems.
          <br />
          I love projects that blend functionality with great design, like <strong
            >JustBeans</strong
          >, where I independently built a full-fledged business website with
          authentication, payments, and user engagement. My experience with
          Supabase, API integrations, and Paystack has helped me build impactful
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          My core strength is in <strong>frontend development</strong> â€” Iâ€™m skilled
          in JavaScript, <strong>React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m also a great team player who thrives in collaborative
          environments. I bring a growth mindset, strong communication, and keen
          attention to detail to every project.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, I write about my journey on <strong>
            <a
              href="https://hashnode.com/@Ebuntoday"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashnode</a
            >
          </strong>, sharing insights on development, self-improvement, and
          problem-solving. I also <strong>
            share honest reflections on LinkedIn
          </strong>â€”especially around consistency, growth, self-leadership, and
          purposeful learning as a developer.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love contributing to purpose-driven projects that
          require giving back to the community and have volunteered in roles
          that let me support teams with web development, design feedback, and
          outreach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m open to collaborations that challenge me to grow and deliver real
          value and lasting impact. Letâ€™s build something impactful together. ðŸš€
